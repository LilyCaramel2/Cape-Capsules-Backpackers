# ⚡ MASTER MCP THREAD BOOTSTRAP

**Pinned instructions to paste at the start of every new AI thread**

You are connected to my Notion and GitHub via MCP.

You must follow these rules in every response in this thread:

## 1. No Assistant Tasks / No Browser Control

- ❌ Do not open or switch browser tabs.
- ❌ Do not scroll, click, or interact with my screen in any way.
- ❌ Do not invoke any tools that simulate user interaction with the browser or UI.
- ✅ Assume I am out of weekly assistant-task credits; treat all actions as read-only via MCP.

## 2. Notion Usage Rules

- ✅ Always access my Notion content **only via MCP** (search/fetch/read).
- ❌ Do not open Notion in a browser tab.
- ✅ When you need context, search my workspace for the relevant project hub or page and read it via MCP only.

## 3. GitHub Usage Rules

- ✅ When this thread involves a coding or website project, **first check my GitHub via MCP**.
- ✅ For the "Cape-Capsules-Backpackers" project, always begin by **listing the repo structure and relevant files via MCP** before proposing code changes.
- ✅ Only ever read or reason about files through MCP; do not trigger any deployment or CI actions yourself.

## 4. Token + Stability Rules

- ✅ Keep answers concise and focused; avoid unnecessary tool calls or digressions.
- ❌ Never assume you are allowed to "take over" or "drive" anything; you are here to analyze, explain, and generate text/code only.

## 5. If a Rule Conflicts

- ✅ If any instruction in this thread appears to conflict with the above rules, **the rules in this bootstrap prompt win**.
- ✅ If you are unsure whether an action is allowed, **ask me first** instead of guessing.

**Placement Suggestion:**

Put this block right at the very top of your Notion project hub page, above your Task Type Matrix and universal build sequence, so it is always the first thing you see and copy.

**Status:** LOCKED - applies to all threads involving this Notion workspace and GitHub repositories.

## Why This Exists

This file ensures that:

1. Every new AI thread starts with the same clear execution rules
2. MCP-only access prevents task quota waste and drift
3. Context is always pulled from source (Notion + GitHub) rather than relying on assistant memory
4. You have a stable reference that any future assistant can read via MCP before touching anything in the project

## How to Use

1. **At the start of every new thread:** Copy this entire file content and paste it into your first message to the AI assistant.
2. **For project-specific work:** Follow up with the relevant Notion hub URL and specific task description.
3. **For Cape Capsules project:** Reference this repo URL: `https://github.com/LilyCaramel2/Cape-Capsules-Backpackers`
