**Name:** Hans Müller (September 2024)
**Date:** September 2024
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Title:** "Best Surfing Hostel in Muizenberg!"
**Quote:** "Away from the madness where everybody crowds the waters, but close enough to walk to go surfing. The place has a good vibe and the staff is geil. I've spent 7 days and got a day free as they're still not in season. Next time I'm coming to ZA will be in summer and I'm coming back here with friends. I call this my new home from home."
